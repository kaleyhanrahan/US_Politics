1. Democracy and Public Health: http://rpubs.com/kaleyhanrahan/251384
2. Presidential Debates - Feature Engineering and Text Analysis
3. Presidential Election Results 2016 - Tableau Visualizations. These 2 visualizations are designed to work in tandem with one another.
        I initialy created tableauViz1, which shows county election result margins by geography.
        However, I found that this did not tell the full story.
        tableauViz2 shows county election result margins by populations size, painting a very different picture.
